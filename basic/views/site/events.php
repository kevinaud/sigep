    		<h3 class="text-center">Dating Doctor</h3>

    		<p class="text-justify">Each Fall, our members are blessed to partner with the beautiful women of Alpha Chi Omega to host the All-University event, Dating Doctor.  The event features renowned relationship specialist, fellow SigEp Brother, and real life Hitch, David Coleman, who educates the student body on healthy relationships while providing a few tips to land a date with that cute girl from class or find that Mr. to your Mrs.  Dating Doctor has quickly become a highly anticipated tradition that we hope to continue for years to come.</p>

    		<h3 class="text-center">Intramurals</h3>

    		<p class="text-justify">In the Fall, our chapter competes in and submits two teams to both Dodgeball and Flag Football, and in the spring, we compete in Basketball, Soccer, and Softball.  Although we have not brought home an intramural championship, the chapter has seen tremendous success by making playoff runs in Dodgeball, Flag Football, and Basketball. </p>

    		<h3 class="text-center">Float</h3>

    		<p class="text-justify">As part of Baylor University’s Homecoming festivities, we submit a float to the Homecoming Parade.  In past years, we have competed in the Class A Float competition while partnering with the lovely ladies of Alpha Chi Omega with themes of “Luau” and "Rome".  This year, we partnered with the beautiful women of Alpha Delta Pi and built a 
    		Las Vegas themed float.</p>
