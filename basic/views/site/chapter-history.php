    		<p class="text-justify">The Texas Rho chapter of Sigma Phi
    		 Epsilon was first chartered at Baylor University in 1976.  
    		 For nearly 30 years, the chapter and its brotherhood thrived 
    		 on Baylor’s campus and created a rich tradition of campus 
    		 involvement and success in academic, philanthropic, and 
    		 professional fields.  Throughout Texas Rho’s early years, 
    		 the chapter and its members befriended Mr. and Mrs. Barry Winn, 
    		 known to our members as, “Uncle Barry and Aunt Helen.”  For 
    		 years the chapter assisted the elderly couple by helping maintain 
    		 their ranch, and in 1989, as a reward for their service, Texas 
    		 Rho became the first SigEp chapter to receive the Honor of the 
    		 Philias Award.  Uncle Barry and Aunt Helen will always hold a 
    		 special place in the Texas Rho family, and their story will 
    		 continue to be a guiding force in the chapter’s philanthropic 
    		 efforts.</p>

    		<p class="text-justify">Unfortunately, the chapter lost its charter 
    		in 2005, but with strong leadership from undergraduates and immense 
    		support from its alumni base, Texas Rho was re-chartered on January 
    		28, 2011.  Since then, our members have dedicated themselves to 
    		being upstanding members of the Waco and Baylor communities, 
    		through service and campus involvement.</p>
