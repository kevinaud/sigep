    		<p class="text-justify">Sigma Phi Epsilon was founded in 1901 on the 
    		campus of Richmond College (now called the University of Richmond) in 
    		Richmond, Va. The story of its founding by 12 determined men set the 
    		stage for the growth and success of one of the country’s premier fraternal 
    		organizations. The history of the Fraternity reflects the times, 
    		through great wars and profound cultural shifts. Throughout the 
    		decades, the men of Sigma Phi Epsilon have practiced their values 
    		and embraced the stated desire of the Founders, “This Fraternity 
    		will be different.”</p>
