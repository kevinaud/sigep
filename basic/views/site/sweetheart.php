    		woman who has continuosly shown her commitment and support for the betterment of our
    		Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter. The time and talent that this woman extends to SigEp goes beyond
    		measure. We can never express our full appreciation for those special women who have always

    		our letters and attend all of our events.</p>

    		of all sincere in her good nature. No matter what kind of day you're having, she is the one 
    		person who can make it better. Her smile can light up a room, and has on multiple occasions 
    		with Sig Ep. I know that we're all proud to have her as a part of our brotherhood, but whats 
    		even more amazing is how proud she is to be with us. If you ever see her walking on campus or 
    		down the street, I encourage you to stop and meet her. I did five years ago, and my life has

            always know how to make me laugh. They truly have hearts of gold (plus purple/red). 
            I am so proud of this chapter and everything they have accomplished while I’ve known 
            them the last four years. They are hard working, strong-hearted and so genuine. Each 
            member adds something unique, but as a group they share the same important values. 
            Most importantly, they know how to love well. This chapter is capable of doing 
            anything, and I can’t wait to see how they continue to grow. Being a lady of Sig Ep 
            has been the most meaningful experience. I am so blessed to have these men in my 
            life. Many women go lifetimes trying to find quality guys, and I’ve already found 
            50! Getting to serve these gentlemen has been the best experience. They have truly 
            made my time at Baylor so precious and one-of-a-kind. Sigma Phi Epsilon has changed 
            my life in the best possible way. I can’t imagine my life without these boys. Thank 
            you so much for letting me be a part of your family! Love you guys!"</em></h4>
