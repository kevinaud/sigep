    		<h3 class="text-center">Kim Orlando Invitational</h3>

    		<p class="text-justify">Each Fall, our Alumni and Undergraduate members 
    		come together for a weekend to honor and celebrate the life of fellow Texas 
    		Rho Brother and fallen soldier, Lt. Colonel Kim S. Orlando (Fall 1979) at 
    		the Kim Orlando Invitational (KOI).  In Kim’s honor, the proceeds of the 
    		tournament go directly to The Fischer House in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, home
    		of the 101st Airborne.</p>

    		<p class="text-justify">Since 2006, KOI has brought the Texas Rho family together
    		to raise over $30,000 which have been used to donate a memorial fountain in Fort 
    		Campbell, place a memorial plaque on Baylor’s campus, and provide almost $17,000 
    		worth of gift cards and cash for families visiting their wounded soldiers at The 
    		Fischer House.</p>

    		<p class="text-justify">We would like to give special thanks to all of those who 
    		donate and sponsor KOI, without whom, the event could not be as successful as 
    		it has been.  We would also like to send a thank you to Texas Rho Alum, Mr. 
    		Charles Gamble, for organizing the tournament and bringing the Texas Rho family 
    		together each year.</p>

    		<p class="text-justify">This past Spring, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Alpha Delta Pi 
    		partnered at the national level to organize and implement the Live Your Oath 
    		campaign.  The program was created to empower both male and female members of 
    		college campuses to be educated and aware of the risks and realities of sexual 
    		harassment and sexual assault that exist on college campuses today</p>
